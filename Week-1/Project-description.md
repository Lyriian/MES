# Desktop-assistant
Despite having multiple monitors on my desktop I often find myself without enough screen space. Adding on the issue that I generally have a dozen programs open at any time with multiple tabs in some programs it can become tedious to start minimizing things or moving things to get to other menus. So my solution to this would be the desktop assistant. A small USB connected device with a TFT touch screen for displaying various information (system resources by default) and also allow you to have a shortcuts menu to either open or close various programs. It would also include several physical knobs / buttons that can be mapped to various commands. The one I'm most looking forward to is knobs for controlling individual volume sliders without having to go 3 menus deep into the windows volume mixer menu. Also a physical mute button for when you can't be bothered to tab out and find your zoom window to respond to a question in a meeting you were half paying attention to.

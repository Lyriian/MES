# Week 2
Assignment was to investigate both the board we intend to use for our final project as well as a board we were randomly assigned. For each board we were to include the hardware block diagram as well as answer the following questions:

● What kind of processor is it?

● How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?

● Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you find interesting.)

● If it has an ADC, what are the features?

● How much does the board cost vs what the processor costs? Is the processor in stock
anywhere? (Try Digikey, Mouser, Octopart, Google, and so on.)

We were also asked to take a look at some of the application notes for the boards.

The board I will be using for my final project is the STM32F429I-DISC1 and the board I was assigned for the project was the MIMXRT1060-EVK and a markdown file for each is included here.

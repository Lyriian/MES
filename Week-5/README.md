# Lesson 6 (Part 1): Add a Command Line Interface

One of the requirements for your final project is to have a serial interface. Chapter 3 talked
about testing the hardware and software with a command pattern. This sort of testing lets you
try pieces on the hardware over and over, making debugging easier.

I have a Wokwi simulation of a command line interface:

The code can also be found in github, configured to run in Windows (see ConsoleIo.c).

Port this code to your system. Add three commands that may be useful in testing your hardware
or software.

Bonus:
Update (or create) the Chapter 2 diagrams for your final project.
Turn in a link to a github repository before 9am on Saturday.
